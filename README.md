## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi! I am a **Data Science & Decision Support Systems Master's Student** with a background in **International Business Administration (IBA)**.

My unique strength lies in being a "Purple Person" in the tech industry—someone who understands both the **business logic** (Red) and the **technical execution** (Blue).

## 🚀 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how core data analysis tasks translate across the three most essential tools in the industry. It serves as a interactive handbook for:
* **Excel:** For quick prototyping and business communication.
* **SQL:** For database querying and data extraction.
* **Python (Pandas):** For advanced data manipulation, automation, and statistical analysis.

## 📂 Repository Contents
The main analysis is located in the **[`The_Analyst_Handbook.ipynb`](The_Analyst_Handbook.ipynb)** file. It covers a complete End-to-End analysis lifecycle:

| Part | Topic | Key Skills Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **Data Generation** | Python scripting to create realistic E-Commerce datasets. |
| **1** | **Exploration** | Data slicing, filtering, and initial assessment. |
| **2** | **Aggregation** | Replicating "Pivot Table" logic using `GROUP BY`. |
| **3** | **Data Merging** | Performing `LEFT JOIN` (VLOOKUP) operations to combine datasets. |
| **4** | **Data Cleaning** | Handling `NULL` values and standardizing messy text strings. |
| **5** | **Time Series** | Date extraction, seasonality analysis, and calculating recency. |
| **6** | **Logic (If/Else)** | Customer segmentation using Conditional Logic (`CASE WHEN`). |
| **7** | **Advanced Stats** | Window Functions (`RANK`, `Running Total`, `LAG`) for reporting. |

## 🛠️ How to Run
This project is self-contained.
1.  Open `The_Analyst_Handbook.ipynb`.
2.  Run the **Part 0** cell first to generate the `ecommerce_data.csv` file automatically.
3.  Run the subsequent cells to see the comparative analysis.

## 💡 Business Value
This project proves the ability to:
* Identify **High-Value Customers** (Churn & Segmentation).
* Analyze **Sales Trends** over time (Seasonality).
* Clean and Prepare messy data for **Decision Making**.
